This app has been created with lots of thought and love by a person in Germany.

Like all projects, this could not have been done without the support of so many!

## [Avocation](https://avocation.app/)

I loved the design of the Avocation app so very much (I even put this up as a review!). The pastel colors, the brilliant fonts, the little cute characters, just so wonderful! I'm no UX designer, and this was my attempt at flattery by using the Avocation app as a guide.

## [Get Intention](https://www.getintention.com/)

Originally inspired by this idea. I've used the web extension on and off but it never cut it for me - especially because the laptop isn't my source of distraction. The app I've build is my version of solving the problem of attention by setting Intentions.
